Trident Studios quickly became a place where creatives flourished, and musical legends descended on it to escape the laboratory mentality of places like Abbey Road. \n\nThe Beatles recorded ‘Hey Jude’, David Bowie cut ‘Ziggy Stardust’ and ‘Hunky Dory’, and Norman invested in a band called Queen who cut their teeth in the studio and set about re-shaping rock music for good. The list is endless. Lou Reed, Elton John, Carly Simon, Peter Gabriel, Joe Cocker, The Rolling Stones, James Taylor, and Dusty Springfield all making iconic recordings that shaped the music we hear today.\n\nTrident is our legacy. So when you use our little app for creating, you are joining the ranks of so many greats who did so much for the better.\n\nMake a Sound! Share your songs with @trackdmusic and #trackd for the chance to be featured, and were always here at support@trackdmusic.com if you have any queries, needs, or feedback.", "bundleId":"com.tridentcloud.collaborate", "version":"2.4.4", "wrapperType":"software", "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":297},
